Playing around with JS to make Snake

This project was done to mess around with JavaScript and get a good feel for using it. Snake was made to use aspects of JS that I've never used before, and it worked perfectly. As it is, this project works fine just as it comes. In the future more games may be added to get an even better grip of JavaScript.
