# Basic-Javascript-Snake

This project was an old HW assignment to get down the basics of Javascript and jQuery. The snake eats Computer Sciences courses offered at the Stony Brook University, but each time the courses are randomized. It can be modified to change the game speed or decrease the needed score to win as well. It also has a little bit of SBU flair as a bonus!
